# Simpson Clue Solver

We play board games.

And by we... I mean my family. In my nuclear (new-clee-are) family... I have some stiff competition. My wife is... on the right side of the bell curve. So the kids... they are smarter than me. We play clue. I lose.

They can track all the cards with their MINDS!

I could lie and say that this app is a way for me to get better at React- you know, to support the mission-critical apps I'm building at work.

But you understand me. I feel like I can be real with you.

I'm building this to destroy their hopes of ever winning another game of Simpsons Clue!

Mwu ha ha ha! Mwu ha ha ha!
